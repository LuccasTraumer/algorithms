# Bouble Sort Algorithm
***n =*** **number os elements on data stucture.**<br> 
Bouble sort is a algorithms to sort data, where we maded a ***n-1*** comparation bethween elements in structure.
And carry the large element to end of list.

Logic in the algorithm is:<br> 
has two loops chained where they go to the end of list. And where inside the second loop is where we make a comparison.<br>
If ***x*** is more biggest what ***x+1***, we are changed this two of position.
***x =*** **element in a position on structure.**<br>
